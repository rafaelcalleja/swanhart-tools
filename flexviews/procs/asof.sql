CREATE  PROCEDURE flexviews.asof(

)
  MODIFIES SQL DATA
  COMMENT 'Copies a materialized view into the new view refreshed to a specific point in time'
proc: BEGIN
/****f* UTIL_API/asof
 * NAME
 *   flexviews.asof - Computes and applies changes to a view to move it to a specified datetime
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   flexviews.asof(v_mview_id, 
                       v_when);
 * FUNCTION
 *   This function moves a given view to a specific point in time. It can move views both
 *   forward and backward in time.  The REFRESH function is not capable of this.
 * INPUTS
 *   This function takes a combination of input parameters:
 *   * v_mview_id - The materialized view identifier
 *   * v_when - A DATETIME value that indicates when the view will be refreshed to
 * NOTES
 *   The external binary log consumer MUST BE RUNNING!
 * SEE ALSO
 *   flexviews.refresh
 * EXAMPLE
 *   mysql>
 *     set @mv_id = flexviews.get_id('test', 'mv_example');
 *     call flexviews.asof(@mv_id, '2016-09-22 22:22:22');
